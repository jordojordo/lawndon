# Lawndon Lite

> Note: Lawndon is a WIP and the construction can be modified entirely to fit your desired needs. 

Before turning Lawndon into an autonomous mower, the first step is to create a remote controlled mower which can tackle any terrain. This can be accomplished by recycling any "outdated" electric mower you can find, I found a suitable [24v Worx mower](https://www.worx.com/24v-cordless-lawn-mower-wg782.html) which someone was throwing out. Eventually, I would like to construct a complete build for Lawndon that is reproducable by anyone with a 3d printer.

The main idea is to have a high torque, low power mower to be efficient and powerful enough to climb hills. In order to acheive this I used 2 [360KV brushless motors](https://www.rctimer.com/rctimer-5010-360kv-multicopter-brushless-motor-p0233.html) to power a 56:1 gearbox that is attached to tracks. The gears and tracks are based on [Rctestflight's Snowcat design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4308626).

## Configuration
 
Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/jordojordo/lawndon-lite/wiki) for prerequisites, required materials, and configuration instructions.

## TODO

- Design printable chassis
- Configure RC reciever to be agnostic
- Create proper wire routing scheme
